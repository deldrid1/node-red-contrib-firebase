node-red-contrib-firebase
=========================

<A HREF="http://nodered.org">node-red</A> <A HREF="http://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/">nodes</A> for interacting with <A HREF="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</A>.

The goal of this project is to provide an elegant GUI that allows you to interact with your Firebase data using Node-Red.  

As a side benefit, these nodes should be a natural complement to the data explorer interface offered by the Firebase Forge and a faster/easier to use tool than diving straight into the programming libraries offered for all of the <A HREF="https://www.firebase.com/docs/">Firebase supported platforms</A>.  

This project is a work in progress and currently only supports connections to Firebases without Authentication or those secured with Email and Password Authentication (other flavors are coming...)

#Install

Run the following command after you have done a global install of Node-RED (as described at <A HREF="http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html">http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html</A>)

	sudo npm install -g node-red-contrib-firebase

##Manual Installation
#####The following instructions assume a standard installation of Node-Red.  Please adjust directories accordingly if a non-standard installation is used.  
#####The Node-Red _user directory_ is printed to the Terminal whenever Node-Red is launched.
#####Windows users will need to replace "$HOME" with "%HOMEPATH%" and replace forwardslashes with backslashes.

To manually install :

1. Download this repository (via git clone, as a .zip, etc.)

2. Launch your favorite Terminal / Command Prompt

3. Create a `nodes` folder in the Node-Red _user directory_.  
_Don't worry if you see a `cannot create directory, File exists` error - that simply means this directory has already been created._

		mkdir $HOME/.node-red/nodes

4. cd into the `.node-red/nodes` user directory of Node-RED

		cd $HOME/.node-red/nodes

5. Copy the `node-red-contrib-firebase` folder into the `.node-red/nodes` directory.  The final directory structure should be `$HOME/.node-red/nodes/node-red-contrib-firebase/`

		cp -r $HOME/Downloads/node-red-contrib-firebase/ ./node-red-contrib-firebase/

6. cd into the `node-red-contrib-firebase` folder

		cd node-red-contrib-firebase

7. Install the required dependencies

		npm install

#Usage

To use the nodes, launch Node-RED (see <A HREF="http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/running.html">http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/running.html</A> for help getting started).

The firebase nodes will appear in their own "firebase" catagory on the Node-Red pallet. Drag and drop any node onto the canvas and configure as you would any other node-red node.  Node specific configuration information for each node is included in the info pane in Node-Red.

###Limitations
All references to a Firebase share the same authentication status, so if you create two config nodes pointing to the same Firebase they will end up sharing identical authentication credentials (whichever configuration node authenticates last will "win").

See <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25374999/multiple-firebases-instances">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25374999/multiple-firebases-instances</A> for more information on this issue.  

#Example Application
If you are brand new to Node-Red, one simple way to get started is to use an existing flow.

- Start by copying the following to your clipboard

```

```
- <A HREF="http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/running.html">Launch Node-Red</A> and open the web user interface (Located at <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:1880">http://127.0.0.1:1880</A> by default).

- Click the menu drop down in the top right corner and select Import -> Clipboard.

- Paste the contents of your clipboard in and click "OK".

- Click in the pallete to place the nodes.

- You now need to configure login credentials for each node with a Red Triangle.  You can add new credentials by double clicking on any firebase node and clicking on the pencil icon in the top right corner of the edit dialog box. Once you have created a set of credentials they will be available in the drop down box for use in other nodes.

- Press the Deploy Button in the top right corner and begin experimenting!

##Potential Node-Red Installation Issues on Windows

For Node-Red installations on Windows using Node.JS v0.12, you may run into missing compiler dependencies from npm and see MSBUILD errors.  Installing <A HREF="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio Community</A> should fix this issue.

##Node.JS on Windows behind a Corporate Proxy Server
If you are using Node.JS on Windows behind a corporate proxy server, you will likely run into issues with
node programs and npm.  Run the following commands to inform node of your proxy settings (modify the values to fit your proxy setup):

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    npm config set proxy http://myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    npm config set https-proxy http://myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port

If authentication is required by your proxy, you may need to use the following syntax:

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://domain%5Cuser:password@myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://domain%5Cuser:password@myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    npm config set proxy http://domain%5Cuser:password@myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port
    npm config set https-proxy http://domain%5Cuser:password@myproxy.myproxydomain.com:port

To undo these changes for use outside of a proxied environment run

    set HTTP_PROXY=
    set HTTPS_PROXY=
    npm config delete proxy
    npm config delete https-proxy

#//TODO: List
- All of the ones scattered throughout the code

- Code cleanup and commenting (using jsDoc?)

- Make some errors "sticky" so we don't report innappropriate status in case the page is loaded after initial deploy as the errors could be missed later and make debugging flows difficult (need to come up with a list of what is/isn't recoverable and under what conditions...)

- Once Firebase allows multiple references to have different authentications, we will need to change the singleton architecture that we have in place currently...

- Validation on HTML and Javascript, ensuring that only a single firebaseurl is allowed in a config node at a time (due to the way firebase auth works)

- Add ability to set .priorities with firebase_modify nodes (none, timestamp, number, string, msg.priority, etc.)

- Extend .on to optionally allow for Firebase queries
  orderby*, startAt (value and key for orderbypriority), endAt (value and key for orderbypriority), equalTo, limitToFirst, limitToLast, limit, etc.

- Add support for remaining Firebase Authentication strategies including facebook, twitter, GitHub and Google. (the twitter Node likely should provide good inspiration for how to do this)

- Add support for .ondisconnect to allow nodes to manage presence

- Expose more of the Firebase API and add nodes for creating users, updating passwords, etc.?
